							<i>Intel Inside? More like Intel Outside!</i></span>
							<p>It's quite an understatement to say that I have learned a lot from my time at Intel. My internships at Intel have been moments of my life I will never forget. I've met many of my closest friends over the past few years while growing both personally and professionally such a great company.

							<p>
								In my first internship I was exposed to web development for the first time, and was able to deliver a product that is still in use today. The ability of displaying more accurate deadlines for
								SSD testing timelines has saved hundreds of hours of confusion between product owners and employees running the tests. Working with a small team allowed me to ask others for help while still
								maintaining my own independence which pushed me to learn more on my own.
							</p>
							<p>
								My second internship at Intel was still on the same team as 2017, but this time I was given a more impactful task of refactoring and reimplementing over 4000 unit tests for our internal testing
								website. All of our unit tests were implemented with the Karma testing framework, as most web applications using AngularJS are. After 2+ years of development, there had been no focus on implementing the tests, so I had taken up the challenge of figuring out what went wrong. At the end of my internship, I was able to get 
								all unit tests running and only ~300 failing, most of which were dependency issues that had not been updated with our codebase. I also learned some valuable leadership
								values as I had to mentor two incoming high school interns who were in the same position as I was during my first internship.
							</p>
							<p>
								In my most recent internship, I swapped teams to work more on hardware
								testing. It was quite a switch from the last internships I had, but I wanted to try something different. I worked with the Altiris platform to develop scripts in Python and VisualBasic to deploy OS images to pre-production reference platforms. The previous deployment process took ~2 hours per board, but with the scripts I implemented each deployment took less than 20 minutes. I was able to accomplish that task pretty early on, and took on the task of building an inventory check-out system for our lab. I built a scanner kiosk website for anyone in the lab needing to check-out hardware in a jiff.
